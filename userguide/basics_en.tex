\chapter{\codeblocks Project Management}

The instructions in several paragraphs (for example \pxref{sec:plugins} or \pxref{sec:variables_types}) are official documentations of the \codeblocks Wiki site (eventually reviewed and amended) and available in english only.
This documentation is an extension of the original version 1.1, compiled and/or written by Mario Cupelli.

The below illustration shows the design of the \codeblocks user interface.

\figures[H][width=\columnwidth]{codeblocks}{IDE \codeblocks}

\begin{description}
\item[Management] This window contains the interface \menu{Projects} which will in the following text be referred to as the project view. This view show all the projects opened in \codeblocks at a certain time. The \samp{Symbols} tab of the Management window shows symbols, variables etc..
\item[Editor] In the above illustration, a source named \file{hello.c} is opened with syntax highlighting in the editor.
\item[Open files list] shows a list of all files opened in the editor, in this example: \file{hello.c}.
\item[CodeSnippets] can be displayed via the menu \menu{View,CodeSnippets}. Here you can manage text modules, links to files and links to urls.
\item[Logs \& others] This window is used for outputting search results, log messages of a compiler etc...
\end{description}

The status bar gives an overview of the following settings:

\begin{itemize}
\item Absolute path of an opened file in the editor.
\item The editor uses the default character encoding of your host operating system. This setting will be displayed with \codeline{default}.
\item Row and column number of the current cursor position in the editor.
\item The configured keyboard mode for inserting text (Insert or Overwrite).
\item Current state of a file. A modified file will be marked with \codeline{Modified} otherwise this entry is empty.
\item The permission of a file. A file with read only settings will display \codeline{Read only} in the status bar. In the window \menu{Open files list} these files will be emphasised with a lock as icon overlay.

\hint{In the active editor the user can select the context menu properties. In the appearing dialog in the tab \menu{General} the option \menu{File is read-only} can be selected. This option will result in a read-only access of the corresponding file within \codeblocks, but the original read and write attributes of the file on the filesystem are not modified.}

\item If you start \codeblocks with the command line option \opt{--personality=\var{profile}} then the status bar will show the currently used profile, otherwise \codeline{default} will be shown. The settings of \codeblocks are stored in the corresponding configuration file \file{\var{personality}.conf}.
\end{itemize}

\codeblocks offers a very flexible and comprehensive project management. The following text will address only some of the features of the project management.

\section{Project View}\label{sec:categories}

In \codeblocks, the sources and the settings for the build process are stored in a project file \file{\var{name}.cbp}. C/C++ sources and the corresponding header files are the typical components of a project. The easiest way to create a new project is  executing the command \menu{File,Project} and selecting a wizard. Then you can add files to the project via the context menu \menu{Add files} in the Management window.

\codeblocks governs the project files in categories according to their file extensions. These are the preset categories:

\begin{description}
\item[Sources] includes source files with the extensions \file{*.c;*.cpp;}.
\item[ASM Sources] includes source files with the extensions \file{*.s;*.S;*.ss;*.asm}.
\item[Headers] includes, among others, files with the extension \file{*.h;}.
\item[Resources] includes files for layout descriptions for wxWidgets windows with the extensions \file{*.res;*.xrc;}. These file types are shown in the \samp{Resources} tab of the Manangement window.
\end{description}

The settings for types and categories of files can be adjusted via the context menu \menu{Project tree,Edit file types \& categories}. Here you can also define custom categories for file extensions of your own. For example, if you wish to list linker scripts with the \file{*.ld} extension in a category called \file{Linkerscript}, you only have to create the new category.

\hint{If you deactivate \menu{Project tree,Categorize by file types} in the context menu, the category display will be switched off, and the files will be listed as they are stored in the file system.}

\section{Notes for Projects}

In \codeblocks, so-called notes can be stored for a project. These notes should contain short descriptions or hints for the corresponding project. By displaying this information during the opening of a project, other users are provided with a quick survey of the project. The display of notes can be switched on or off in the Notes tab of the Properties of a project.

\section{Project Templates}

\codeblocks is supplied with a variety of project templates which are displayed when creating a new project. However, it is also possible to store custom templates for collecting your own specifications for compiler switches, the optimisation to be used, machine-specific switches etc. in templates. These templates will be stored in the \file{Documents and Settings\osp \var{user}\osp Application Data\osp codeblocks\osp UserTemplates} directory in Win 7 (or an equivalent path in the user profile, adapted to each OS). If the templates are to be open to all users, they have to be copied to a corresponding directory of the \codeblocks installation. These templates will then be displayed at the next startup of \codeblocks under \menu{New, Project,User templates}.

\hint{The available templates in the Project Wizard can be edited by selection via right-click.}

\section{Create Projects from Build Targets}

In projects it is necessary to have different variants of the project available. Variants are called Build Targets. They differ with respect to their compiler options, debug information and/or choice of files. A Build Target can also be outsourced to a separate project. To do so, click \menu{Project,Properties}, select the variant from the tab \samp{Build Targets} and click the \samp{Create project from target} button (see \pxref{fig:build_targets}).

\screenshot{build_targets}{Build Targets}

\section{Virtual Targets}

Projects can be further structured in \codeblocks by so-called Virtual Targets. A frequently used project structure consists of two Build Targets, one \samp{Debug} Target which contains debug information and one \samp{Release} Target without this information. By adding Virtual Targets via \menu{Project,Properties,Build Targets} individual Build Targets can be combined. For example, a Virtual Target \samp{All} can create the Targets Debug and Release simultaneously. Virtual Targets are shown in the symbol bar of the compiler under Build Targets.

\section{Pre- and Postbuild steps}\label{sec:pre_postbuild}

\codeblocks makes it possible to perform additional operations before or after compiling a project. These operations are called Prebuilt or Postbuilt Steps. Typical Postbuilt Steps are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Creating an Intel Hexformat from a finished object
\item Manipulating objects by \cmdline{objcopy}
\item Generating dump files by \cmdline{objdump}
\end{itemize}

\genterm{Example}

Creating a Disassembly from an object under Windows. Piping to a file requires calling \cmdline{cmd} with the \opt{/c} option.

\begin{lstlisting}
cmd /c objdump -D name.elf > name.dis
\end{lstlisting}

Archiving a project can be another example for a Postbuilt Step. For this purpose, create a Build Target \samp{Archive} and include the following instruction in the Postbuilt Step:

\begin{lstlisting}
zip -j9 $(PROJECT_NAME)_$(TODAY).zip src h obj $(PROJECT_NAME).cbp
\end{lstlisting}

With this command, the active project and its sources, header and objects will be packed as a zip file. In doing so, the Built-in variables \codeline{$(PROJECT_NAME)} and \codeline{$(TODAY)}, the project name and the current date will be extracted (see \pxref{sec:builtin_variables}). After the execution of the Target \samp{Archive}, the packed file will be stored in the project directory.

In the \file{share/codeblocks/scripts} directory you will find some examples for scripts. You can add a script via menu \menu{Settings,Scripting} and register in a menu. If you execute e.g. the script \file{make\_dist} from the menu then all files belonging to a project will be compressed in an archive \file{\var{project}.tar.gz}.

\section{Adding Scripts in Build Targets}

\codeblocks offers the possibility of using menu actions in scripts. The script represents another degree of freedom for controlling the generation of your project.

\hint{A script can also be included at a Build Target.}

\section{Workspace and Project Dependencies}

In \codeblocks, multiple projects can be open. By saving open projects via \menu{File,Save workspace} you can collect them in a single workspace under \file{\var{name}.workspace}. If you open \file{\var{name}.workspace} during the next startup of von \codeblocks, all projects will show up again.

Complex software systems consist of components which are managed in different \codeblocks projects. Furthermore, with the generation of such software systems, there are often dependencies between these projects.

\genterm{Example}

A project A contains fundamental functions which are made available to other projects in the form of a library. Now, if the sources of this project are modified, then the library has to be rebuilt. To maintain consistency between a project B which uses the functions and project A which implements the functions, project B has to depend on project A. The necessary information on the dependencies of projects is stored in the relevant workspace, so that each project can be created separately. The usage of dependencies makes it also possible to control the order in which the projects will be generated. The dependencies for projects can be set via the selecting the menu \menu{Project,Properties} and then clicking the \samp{Project's dependencies} button.

\section{Including Assembler files}

In the Management window of the Project View, Assembler files are shown in the \file{ASM Sources} category. The user can change the listing of files in categories (see \pxref{sec:categories}). Right-clicking one of the listed Assembler files will open a context menu. Select \menu{Properties} to open a new window. Now select the \samp{Build} tab and activate the two fields \samp{Compile file} and \samp{Link file}. Then select the \samp{Advanced} tab and execute the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Set \samp{Compiler variable} to CC
\item Select the compiler under \samp{For this compiler}
\item Select \samp{Use custom command to build this file}
\item In the window, enter:
\begin{lstlisting}
$compiler $options $includes <asopts> -c $file -o $object
\end{lstlisting}
\end{enumerate}

The \codeblocks variables are marked by \codeline{$} (see \pxref{sec:command_macros}). They are set automatically so that you only have to replace the Assembler option \var{asopt} by your own settings.

\section{Editor and Tools}

This section describe tools in the éditor window.

\subsection{Default Code}

The company's Coding Rules require source files to have a standard design. \codeblocks makes it possible to include a predefined content at the beginning of a file automatically when creating new C/C++ sources and headers. This predefined content is called default code. This setting can be selected under \menu{Settings,Editor} Default Code. If you create a new file then a macro expansion of variables, e.g. defined via menu \menu{Settings,Global variables},  is performed. A new file can be created via the menu \menu{File,New,File}.

\genterm{Example}

\begin{lstlisting}
/***************************************************************
 *  Project: $(project)
 *  Function:
 ***************************************************************
 *  $Author: mario $
 *  $Name:  $
 ***************************************************************
 *
 *  Copyright 2007 by company name
 *
 ***************************************************************/
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Abbreviation}\label{sec:abbreviation}

A lot of typing can be saved in \codeblocks by defining abbreviation. This is done by selecting \menu{Settings,Editor} and defining the abbreviations under the name \var{name}, which can then be called by the keyboard shortcut Ctrl-J (see \pxref{fig:abbreviation}).

\screenshot{abbreviation}{Defining abbreviations}

Parametrisation is also possible by including variables \codeline{$(NAME}) in the abbreviations.

\begin{lstlisting}
#ifndef $(Guard token)
#define $(Guard token)
#endif // $(Guard token)
\end{lstlisting}

When performing the abbreviation \var{name} in the source text and performing Ctrl-J, the content of the variable is requested and included.
%Inherit Class
%Im Editor kann durch Auswahl von Inherit Class \"{u}ber die rechte Maustaste. ???

\subsection{Personalities}\label{sec:personalities}

\codeblocks settings are saved as application data in a file called \file{\var{user}.conf} in the \file{codeblocks} directory. This configuration file contains information such as the last opened projects, settings for the editor, display of symbol bars etc. By default, the \samp{default} personality is set so that the configuration is stored in the file \file{default.conf}. If \codeblocks is called from the command line with the parameter \cmdline{--personality=myuser}, the settings will be stored in the file \file{myuser.conf}. If the profile does not exist already, it will automatically be created. This procedure makes it possible to create the corresponding profiles for different work steps. If you start \codeblocks from the command line with the additional parameter\cmdline{--personality=ask}, a selection box will be displayed for all the available profiles.

\hint{The name of the current profile/personality is displayed in the right corner of the status bar.}

\subsection{Configuration Files}

The \codeblocks settings are stored in the \file{default.conf} profile in the \file{codeblocks} directory of your Application Data. When using personalities (see \pxref{sec:personalities}), the configuration details will be stored in the \file{\var{personality}.conf} file.

The tool \cmdline{cb\_share\_conf}, which can be found in the \codeblocks installation directory, is used for managing and storing these settings.

If you wish to define standard settings for several users of a computer, the configuration file \file{default.conf} has to be stored in the directory \file{\osp Documents and Settings\osp Default User\osp Application Data\osp codeblocks} (in Win 7, or an equivallent profile path for other OS). During the first startup, \codeblocks will copy the presettings from \samp{Default User} to the application data of the current users.

To create a portable version of \codeblocks on a USB stick, proceed as follows. Copy the \codeblocks installation to a USB stick and store the configuration file \file{default.conf} in this directory. The configuration will be used as a global setting. Please take care that the file is writeable, otherwise changes of the configuration cannot be stored.

\subsection{Navigate and Search}

In \codeblocks there are different ways of quick navigation between files and functions. Setting bookmarks is a typical procedure. Via the shortcut Ctrl-B a bookmark is set or deleted in the source file. Via Alt-PgUp you can jump to the previous bookmark, and via Alt-PgDn you can jump to the next bookmark.

If you select the workspace or a project in the workspace in the project view you will be able to search for a file in the project. Just select \menu{Find file} from the context menu, then type the name of the file and the file will be selected. If you hit return this file will be opened in the editor (see \pxref{fig:project_find_file}).

\screenshot[H][width=.45\columnwidth]{project_find_file}{Searching for files}

In \codeblocks you can easily navigate between header/source files like:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Set cursor at the location where a header file is included and open this file via the context menu \menu{open include file} (see \pxref{fig:open_header})
\item Swap between header and source via the context menu \menu{Swap header/source}
\item Select e.g. a define in the editor and choose \menu{Find declaration} from the context menu to open the file with its declaration.
\end{enumerate}

\screenshot{open_header}{Opening of a header file}

\codeblocks offeres several ways of searching within a file or directory. The dialogue box for searching is opened via \menu{Search,Find} (Ctrl-F) or \menu{Find in Files} (Ctrl-Shift-F).

Alt-G and Ctrl-Alt-G are another useful functions. The dialogue which will open on using this shortcut, lets you select files/functions and then jumps to the implementation of the selected function (see \pxref{fig:select_function}) or opens the selected file in the editor. You may use wildcards like \codeline{*} or \codeline{?} etc. for an incremental search in the dialog.

\screenshot[!hbt][width=.5\columnwidth]{select_function}{Search for functions}

\hint{With the Ctrl-PgUp shortcut you can jump to the previous function, and via Ctrl-PgDn you can jump to the next function.}

In the editor, you can open a new Open Files dialog via Ctrl-Tab and you can switch between the listed entries. If the Ctrl-key is pressed, then a file can be selected in different ways:

\begin{enumerate}
\item If you select an entry with the left mouse button, then the selected file will be opened.
\item If you press the Tab-key you will switch between the listed entries. Releasing the Crtl-key will open the selected file.
\item If you move the mouse over the listed entries, then the current selection will be highlighted. Releasing the Crtl-key will open the selected file.
\item If the mouse pointer is  outside the highlighted selection, then you can use the mouse-wheel to switch between the entries. Releasing the Crtl-key will open the selected file.
\end{enumerate}

A common procedure when developing software is to struggle with a set of functions which are implemented in different files. The Browse Tracker plugin will help you solve this problem by showing you the order in which the files were selected. You can then comfortably navigate the function calls (see \pxref{sec:browsetracker}).

The display of line numbers in \codeblocks can be activated via \menu{Settings,General Settings} in the field \samp{Show line numbers}. The shortcut Ctrl-G or the menu command \menu{Search,Goto line} will help you jump to the desired line.

\hint{If you hold the Ctrl key and then select text in the \codeblocks editor you can perform e.g. a Google search via the context menu.}

\subsection{Symbol view}

The \codeblocks Management window offers a tree view for symbols of C/C++ sources for navigating via functions or variables. As the scope of this view, you can set the current file or project, or the whole workspace.

\hint{Entering a search term or symbol names in the 'Search' input mask of the Symbol Browser results in a filtered view of the symbols if any hits occurred.}

The following categories exist for the symbols:

\begin{description}
\item[Global functions] Lists the implementation of global functions.
\item[Global typedefs] Lists the use of \codeline{typedef} definitions.
\item[Global variables] Displays the symbols of global variables.
\item[Preprocessor symbols] Lists the pre-processor directives created by \codeline{#define}.
\item[Global macros] Lists macros of pre-processor directives.
\end{description}

\figures[H][width=.3\columnwidth]{symbols}{Symbol view}

Structures and classes are displayed in the \menu{bottom tree} and the sort sequence can be modified via the context menu. If a category is selected by mouse-click, the found symbols will be displayed in the lower part of the window (see \pxref{fig:symbols}). Double-clicking the symbol will open the file in which the symbol is defined or the function implemented, and jumps to the corresponding line. An auto-refresh of the symbol browser without saving a file, can be activated via the menu  \menu{Settings,Editor,Code Completion} (see \pxref{fig:cc_realtime_parsing}). For projects with many symbols the performance within \codeblocks will be affected.

\figures[H][width=.85\columnwidth]{cc_realtime_parsing}{Enable real-time parsing}

\hint{In the editor, a list of the classes can be displayed via the context menus \menu{Insert Class method declaration implementation} or \menu{All class methods without implementation}.}

\subsection{Including external help files}

\codeblocks comes with just its own help file: normally, developers need much more help and reference for language, libraries, protocols, file formats and so on. The help plugin makes all the needed documentation available from within \codeblocks itself. Virtually any document can be integrated in the \codeblocks help system, since the help plugin has the ability to launch external programs, if necessary, to view the added documents.

Once added a new help file or document, there will be a new entry in the "Help" menu to open it.
 
The \codeblocks development environment supports the inclusion of external help files via the menu \menu{Settings,Environment}. Include the manual of your choice in the chm format in \menu{Help Files} select \samp{this is the default help file} (see \pxref{fig:help_files}). The entry \codeline{$(keyword)} is a placeholder for a select item in your editor. Now you can select a function in an opened source file in \codeblocks by mouse-click, and the corresponding documentation will appear while pressing F1.

If you have included multiple help files, you can select a term in the editor and choose a help file from the context menu \menu{Locate in} for \codeblocks to search in.

\screenshot{help_files}{Settings for help files}

In \codeblocks you can add even support for man pages. Just add a entry \menu{man} and specify the path as follows.

\begin{lstlisting}
man:/usr/share/man
\end{lstlisting}

On Linux, man pages are usually installed anyway, for Windows you might want to download them e.g. from here: \url{https://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/man}

\textbf{Helpfile options}

\begin{itemize}
\item You can tell \codeblocks to use a file as the default helpfile, checking the "This is the default help file" box. This way, that file will be shown whenever you press the 'F1' key. Moreover, if you write the \$(keyword) as default keyword (see below), this file will be searched for keywords (taking the word selected or the word below the cursor in the current surce file) and will be opened showing the corresponding topic, if present.

\item You can tell \codeblocks to open the helpfile on a topic of your choice, writing the correspondent keyword in the "Default keyword value" textbox. If the helpfile is the default helpfile and you use \$(keyword) as default keyword, the editor will use the word under the cursor (or currently selected) in the current opened file as keyword, opening the default help file at the relevant topic. This will be true, however, only for the default helpfile: any other helpfile or document will not be searched this way. For example, if you have the language reference as default helpfile and add the standard library helpfile, you will have the language keyword explained when hitting 'F1' on them, but won't have the library functions explained this way. Viceversa, setting the standard library helpfile as default will give you the F1 help on them but you will loose this feature for the language keywords.

\item If your helpfile is an HTML file, you can tell \codeblocks to open it with the embedded HTML viewer, checking the corresponding option.
\end{itemize}

\codeblocks provides an \samp{Embedded HTML Viewer}, which can be used to display simple html file and find keywords within this file. Just configure the path to the html file, which should be parsed and enable the checkbox \menu{Open this file with embedded help viewer} via the menu \menu{Settings,Environment,Help Files}.

\screenshot{embedded_html_viewer}{Embedded HTML Viewer}

\hint{If you select a html file with a double-click within the file explorer (see \pxref{sec:file_explorer}) then the embedded html viewer will be started, as long as no association for html files is made in file extensions handler.}

\textbf{CHM Files}

You can find c++ chm help files on the web. Just add them via the dialog.

For Linux you have to install a chm viewer to be able to open chm files. There are severals like gnochm, kchmviewer, xchm and so on.

\subsection{Including external tools}

Including external tools is possible in \codeblocks via \menu{Tools,Configure Tools,Add}. Built-in variables (see \pxref{sec:builtin_variables}) can also be accessed for tool parameters. Furthermore there are several kinds of launching options for starting external applications. Depending on the option, the externally started applications are stopped when \codeblocks is quit. If the applications are to remain open after quitting \codeblocks, the option \menu{Launch tool visible detached} must be set.

\section{Tips for working with \codeblocks}

In this chapter we will present some useful settings in \codeblocks.

\subsection{Tracking of Modifications}

\codeblocks provides a feature to track modifications within a source file and to show a bar in the margin for the changes. Modifications are marked with a yellow changebar and modifications that are already saved will use a green changebar (see \pxref{fig:changebar}). You can navigate between your changes via the menu \menu{Search,Goto next changed line} or \menu{Search,Goto previous changed line}. The same functionality is also accessible via the shortcuts Ctrl-F3 and Ctrl-Shift-F3.

\screenshot{changebar}{Tracking of modifications}

This feature can be enabled or disabled with the checkbox \menu{Use Changebar} in the menu \menu{Settings,Editor,Margins and caret}.

\hint{If a modified file is closed, then the changes history like undo/redo and changebars get lost. Via the menu \menu{Edit,Clear changes history} or the corresponding context menu you are able to clear the changes history even if the file is kept open.}

\subsection{Data Exchange with other applications}

Data can be exchanged between \codeblocks and other applications. For this interprocess communication DDE (Dynamic Data Exchange) is used for windows and under different operating systems it is a TCP based communication.

With this interface different commands with the following syntax can be sent to a \codeblocks instance.

\begin{lstlisting}
[<command>("<parameter>")]
\end{lstlisting}

These commands are currently available:

\begin{description}
\item[Open] The command

\begin{lstlisting}
[Open("d:\temp\test.txt")]
\end{lstlisting}

uses the parameter, in our case it is a file specified with an absolute path, and opens it in an existing \codeblocks instance or starts a first instance if required.
\item[OpenLine] This command opens a file at a given line number in a \codeblocks instance. The line number is specified with \codeline{:line}.

\begin{lstlisting}
[OpenLine("d:\temp\test.txt:10")]
\end{lstlisting}

\item[Raise] Set the focus to the \codeblocks instance. A parameter must not be passed.
\end{description}

\subsection{Configuring environmental variables}\label{sec:EnvVars_Cfg}

See also "Environment Variables Plugin" in \pxref{sec:EnvVar_Plugin}.

The configuration for an operating system is specified by so-called environmental variables. The environmental variable \codeline{PATH} for example contains the path to an installed compiler. The operating system will process this environmental variable from beginning to end, i.e. the entries at the end will be searched last. If different versions of a compiler or other applications are installed, the following situations can occur:

\begin{itemize}
\item An incorrect version of a software is called
\item Installed software packages call each other
\end{itemize}

So it might be the case that different versions of a compilers or other tools are mandatory for different projects. One possibility in such a case is to change the environmental variables in the system control for every project. However, this procedure is error-prone and not flexible. For this requirement, \codeblocks offers an elegant solution. Different configurations of environmental variables can be created which are used only internally in \codeblocks. Additionally, you can switch between these configurations. The \pxref{fig:env_variables} shows the dialogue which you can open via \samp{Environment Varibales} under \menu{Settings,Environment}. A configuration is created via the \samp{Create} button.

\screenshot{env_variables}{Environmental variables}

Access and scope of the environmental variables created here, is limited to \codeblocks. You can expand these environmental variables just like other \codeblocks variables via \codeline{$(NAME)}.

\hint{A configuration for the environmental variable for each project can be selected in the context menu \menu{Properties} of the \samp{EnvVars options} tab.}

\genterm{Example}

You can write the used environment into a postbuild Step (see \pxref{sec:pre_postbuild}) in a file \file{\var{project}.env} and archive it within your project.

\begin{lstlisting}
cmd /c echo \%PATH\%  > project.env
\end{lstlisting}

or under Linux

\begin{lstlisting}
echo \$PATH > project.env
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Switching between perspectives}

Depending on the task in hand, it can be useful to have different configurations or views in \codeblocks and to save these configurations/views. By default, the settings (e. g. show/hide symbol bars, layout, etc.) are stored in the \file{default.conf} configuration file. By using the command line option \opt{--personality=ask} during the start of \codeblocks, different settings can be selected. Apart from this global setting, a situation might occur where you wish to switch between different views of windows and symbol bars during a session. Editing files and debugging projects are two typical examples for such situations. \codeblocks offers a mechanism for storing and selecting different perspectives to prevent the user from frequently having to open and close windows and symbol bars manually. To save a perspective, select the menu \menu{View,Perspectives,Save current} and enter a name at \var{name}. The command \menu{Settings,Editor,Keyboard shortcuts,View,Perspectives,\var{name}} allows a keyboard shortcut to be defined for this process. This mechanism makes it possible to switch between different views by simply using hot keys.

\hint{Another example is editing a file in Full Screen mode without symbol bars. You can create a perspective such as \samp{Full} and assign a hot key for this purpose.}

\subsection{Switching between projects}

If several projects or files are opened at the same time, the user needs a way to switch quickly between the projects or files. \codeblocks has a number of shortcuts for such situations.

\begin{description}
\item[Alt-F5] Activates the previous project from the project view.
\item[Alt-F6] Activates the next project from the project view.
\item[F11] Switches within the editor between a source file \file{\var{name}.cpp} and the corresponding header file \file{\var{name}.h}
\end{description}

\subsection{Extended settings for compilers}

During the build process of a project, the compiler messages are displayed in the Messages window in the Build Log tab. If you wish to receive detailed information, the display can be extended. For this purpose click \menu{Settings,Compiler and Debugger} and select \samp{Other Settings} in the drop-down field.

\screenshot{compiler_debugger}{Setting detail information}

Take care that the correct compiler is selected. The \samp{Full command line} setting in the Compiler Logging field outputs the complete information in the Build Log. In addition, this output can be logged in a HTML file. For this purpose select \samp{Save build log to HTML file when finished}.
Furthermore, \codeblocks offers a progress bar for the build process in the Build Log window which can be activated via the \samp{Display build progress bar} setting.

\subsection{Zooming within the editor}

\codeblocks offers a very efficient editor. This editor allows you to change the size in which the opened text is displayed. If you use a mouse with a wheel, you only need to press the Ctrl key and scroll via the mouse wheel to zoom in and out of the text.

\hint{With the shortcut Ctrl-Numepad-/ or with the menu \menu{Edit,Special commands,Zoom,Reset} the original font size of the active file in the editor is restored.}

\subsection{Wrap Mode}

When editing text files, e. g. \file{*.txt}, within \codeblocks, it might be useful to have the text wrapped, meaning long lines will be displayed in several lines on the screen so that they can be properly edited. The \samp{Word wrap} function can be activated via \menu{Settings,Editor,Other Options} or by setting the checkbox \menu{Word wrap}. The Home and End keys position the cursor at the beginning or end of wrapped lines respectively. When setting \menu{Settings,Editor,Other Options} and \menu{Home key always move to caret to first column}, the cursor will be positioned at the beginning or end of the current line respectively, if the Home or End keys are pressed. If positioning the cursor at the beginning of the first line of the current paragraph is desired, the key combination \menu{Alt-Home} is to be used. The same applies analogously for \menu{Alt-End} for positioning the cursor at the end of the last line of the current paragraph.

\subsection{Select modes in editor}

\codeblocks supports different modes for selecting or pasting of strings.

\begin{enumerate}
\item With the left mouse button a text in the active editor can be selected and then the mouse button can be released. With the mouse wheel the user can scroll to a position. If the middle mouse button is pressed then the formerly selected text will be inserted. This feature is available per file and can be seen a clipboard per file.
\item Pressing the \samp{ALT} key will activate the so-called block-select mode and a rectangle selection can be raised with the left mouse button. If the Alt key is released this selection can be copied or pasted. This feature is helpful if you want to select some columns e.g. of an array and copy and paste the content.
 \item In the menu \menu{Settings,Editor,Margins and Caret} so-called \menu{Virtual Spaces} can be activated. This option enables that a selection in the block select mode can start or end within an empty line.
\item In the menu  \menu{Settings,Editor,Margins and Caret} the \menu{Multiple Selection} can be activated. While holding the Ctrl-key the user can select different lines in the active editor via the left mouse button. The selections will be appended in the clipboard via the shortcut  Ctrl-C or Ctrl-X. Ctrl-V will insert the content at the current cursor position. An additional option  called \menu{Enable typing (and deleting)}  can be activated for multiple selections. This feature is useful if you want to add a pre-processor directive like \codeline{#ifdef} at different source lines or if you want to overwrite or replace a text at several positions.
\end{enumerate}

\hint{Most Linux window managers use ALT-LeftClickDrag to move a window, so you will have to disable this window manager behavior first for block select to work.}

\subsection{Code folding}

\codeblocks supports so called code folding. With this feature you can fold e.g. functions within the \codeblocks editor. A folding point is marked by minus symbol in the left margin of
the editor view. In the margin the beginning and the end of a folding point is visible as vertical line. If you click the minus symbol with the left mouse button the code snippet will be folded or unfolded. Via the menu \menu{Edit,Folding} you can select the folding. In the editor you see folded code as continous horizontal line.

\hint{The folding style and the folding depth limit can be configured via menu \menu{Settings,Editor,Folding}.}

\codeblocks provides the folding feature also for preprocessor directives. To enable this feature select \samp{Fold preprocessor commands} via the menu \menu{Settings,Editor} in the folding entry.

Another possibility is to set user defined folding points. The start of folding point is entered as comment with a opening bracket and the end is market with a comment with a closing bracket.

\begin{verbatim}
//{
code with user defined folding
//}
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Auto complete}

If you open a project in \codeblocks the \samp{Search directories} of your compiler and the project, the sources and headers of your project are parsed. In addition the keywords of the corresponding lexer file are parsed. The parse information is used for the auto complete feature in \codeblocks. Please check the settings for the editor if this feature is enabled. The auto completion is accessible with the shortcut Ctrl-Space. Via the menu \menu{Settings,Editor,Syntax highlighting} you can add user defined keywords to your lexer.

\subsection{Find broken files}

If a file is removed from disk, but is still included in the project file \file{\var{project}.cbp}, then this \samp{broken file} will be shown a broken symbol in the project view. You should use the menu \menu{Remove file from project} instead of deleting files.

In large projects with a lot of subdirectories the search for broken files can be time consuming. \codeblocks offers with the plug-in ThreadSearch (see \pxref{sec:thread_search}) a simple solution for this problem. If you enter a search expression in ThreadSearch and select the option \menu{Project files} or \menu{Workspace files}, then ThreadSearch will parse all files that are included in a project or workspace. If a broken file is found ThreadSerch will issue an error with the missing file.

\subsection{Including libraries}

In the build options of a project, you can add the used libraries via the \samp{Add} button in the \samp{Link libraries} entry of the \samp{Linker Settings}. In doing so, you can either use the absolute path to the library or just give the name without the \file{lib} prefix and file extension.

\genterm{Example}

For a library called \file{\var{path}\osp libs\osp lib\var{name}.a}, just write \file{\var{name}}. The linker with the corresponding search paths will then include the libraries correctly.

\hint{Another way to include libraries is documented in \pxref{sec:lib_finder}.}

\subsection{Object linking order}

During compiling, objects \file{name.o} are created from the sources \file{name.c/cpp}. The linker then binds the individual objects into an application \file{name.exe} or for the embedded systems \file{name.elf}. In some cases, it might be desirable to predefine the order in which the objects will be linked. In \codeblocks, this can be achieved by assigning priorities. In the context menu \menu{Properties}, you can define the priorities of a file in the Build tab. A low priority will cause the file to be linked earlier.

\subsection{Autosave}

\codeblocks offers ways of automatically storing projects and source files, or of creating backup copies. This feature can be activated in the menu \menu{Settings,Environment,Autosave}. In doing so, \samp{Save to .save file} should be specified as the method for creating the backup copy.

\subsection{Settings for file extensions}\label{sec:file_extension}

In \codeblocks, you can choose between several ways of treating file extensions. The settings dialogue can be opened via \menu{Settings,Files extension handling}.
You can either use the applications assigned by Windows for each file extension (open it with the associated application), or change the setting for each extensions in such a way that either a user-defined program will start (launch an external program), or the file will be opened in the \codeblocks editor (open it inside \codeblocks editor).

\hint{If a user-defined program is assigned to a certain file extension, the setting \samp{Disable \codeblocks while the external program is running} should be deactivated because otherwise \codeblocks will be closed whenever a file with this extension is opened.}

\section{\codeblocks at the command line}

IDE \codeblocks can be executed from the command line without a graphic interface. In such a case, there are several switches available for controlling the build process of a project. Since \codeblocks is thus scriptable, the creation of executables can be integrated into your own work processes.

\subsection{Using command line arguments}

If your enter in a command line:\\
\codeline{codeblocks /h}\\
You will see a new window containing a list of arguments:
\begin{lstlisting}
Usage:

\section{Shortcuts}

This section describes the shortcuts which are or can be used in \codeblocks.

\subsection{Introduction}

This plugin can be used to bind one or more key shortcuts to the menu items.

Even if an IDE such as \codeblocks is mainly handled by mouse, keyboard shortcuts are nevertheless a very helpful way of speeding up and simplifying work processes. In the below table, we have collected some of the available keyboard shortcuts.

\subsection{Features}
\begin{description}
\item Includes a configuation panel and a complete system to view/remove/add/edit command shortcuts.
\item Supports multiple key profiles and a complete load/save system is present.
\item Allows the users to customize any menu command they want, and define multiple key-shortcut to each command.
\end{description}

\subsection{Usage}

The configuration page for the plugin can be accessed through the \menu{Settings,Editor} menu, and then selecting the Keyboard Shortcuts section.

\screenshot{KeyBindConfig}{Keyboard shortcuts configuration dialog}

Selecting a command, from the Commands tree, shows the current shortcuts for that command on the right. In the picture Open... is selected and the default shortcut Ctrl-O is displayed.

To add a new shortcut, for the selected command, follow these steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Place the focus on the text box under New Shortcut and press the keys, for example F3 or Ctrl-A.
\item Check Currently assigned to, if another command already has that shortcut you will see it's name there. If the text says None it's safe.
\item Press Add to add the shortcut on the list.
\item Press OK on the dialog to save changes and return to editor.
\end{enumerate}
