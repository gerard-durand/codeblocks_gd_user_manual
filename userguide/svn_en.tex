\section{SVN Support}\label{sec:svn}

\hint{This extension is now obsolete. So you'll probably no more find it in recent \codeblocks versions.}

The support of the version control system SVN is included in the \codeblocks plugin TortoiseSVN. Via the menu \menu{TortoiseSVN,Plugin settings} you can configure the accessible svn commands in the tab \menu{Integration}.

\begin{description}
\item[Menu integration] Add an entry TortoiseSVN with different settings in the menu bar.
\item[Project manger] Activate the TortoiseSVN commands in the context menu of the project manager.
\item[Editor] Active the TortoiseSVN commands in the context menu of the editor.
\end{description}

In the plugin settings you can configure which svn commands are accessible via the menu or the context menu. The tab integration provides the entry \menu{Edit main menu} and \menu{Edit popup menu} to configure these commands.

\hint{The File Explorer in \codeblocks uses different icon overlays for indicating the svn status. The TortoiseSVN commands are included here in the context menu.}
